
This is a website wich provides stories about Cooking and Culture.
There are 3 pages
- index, which is presented with a newspaper style.
- about page
- contact page (not fully working)

The validator is ok 100% with the 3 pages (please see the images included)

The 3 pages are responsive, with different layouts according to the view.

In my opinion are well styled.

Enhacements
- I have used JavaScript function for including the actual date in the index page
- I include a carrousel in the index page, you can see it at the borders. 
  The carrousel shows the articles in a cyclic way, forward and backwards.
  It is programmed 100% in JavaScript without using a plugin.
- The about page include a parallax scrolling effect over the image
- The pages pass the Wave test with only one error due to the instagram icon 
  (I do not want to include a text, please see the images included)
- The footer has the same style and position, with his own css archive
